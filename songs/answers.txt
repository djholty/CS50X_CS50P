Average energy = .659
Average valence = .48444
Average danceability = .71646

Those numbers may be the average of the top 100 songs but the user may only play the top 10 songs 90% of the time
Perhaps a weighted average of the energy valence and danceability using a weighted average of the amount of time spent listening to each song.
