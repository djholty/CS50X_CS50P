Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: TODO
the top two teams differed between 10,000 and 100,000.
Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:
I think if you want to be within a couple of percentage points of the final prediction then you can get that at about
1000 iterations.  10,000 simulations gets you within 1% of of 1,000,0000 simulations.
